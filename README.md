# Project Description
After completing **Supersimpledev's** HTML & CSS course project's <a href="https://supersimple.dev/exercises/youtube" target="_blank">final output</a>, this is my attempt at challenging myself at picking off from the project's base static landing page of YouTube's UI and then tweaking it to add all the missing features and interactability that I wanted to see by only using HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. My continuation is based on YouTube's 2024 UI/UX.

This project is a personal challenge in testing my foundational knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

>**Disclaimer**: I do not own the UI and UX concept of the cloned website. All JS scripts that were used to make this cloned website run are all made by me. For the UI, everything has been imitated only for the purpose of understanding and applying how HTML, CSS, and JS works together. I also do not own any images, logo, and icons used.
