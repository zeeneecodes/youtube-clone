# Project Description
After completing **Supersimpledev's** HTML & CSS course project's <a href="https://supersimple.dev/exercises/youtube" target="_blank">final output</a>, this is my attempt at challenging myself at picking off from the project's base static landing page of YouTube's UI and then tweaking it to add all the missing features and interactability that I wanted to see by only using HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. My continuation is based on YouTube's 2024 UI/UX.

This project is a personal challenge in testing my foundational knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features added / tweaked
- Dynamically load all video data
